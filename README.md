where web devs can get Machine Learning expertise

#Description

##What web devs need
Web devs have started using Machine Learning in their projects. However, they don't know what they are doing. They pick up any gems/libraries/apis available on web and start hacking.

##What Machine Learning experts have to offer
Machine Learning experts are excited about the use of ML in web projects, unfortunately they can't contribute because they don't know much about js, ruby, python, django, RoR etc.

##What do we provide
This proof-of-concept project tries to bridge the gap between them. It will expose [weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) interface to ML experts via web. ML experts can implemeent an ML solution for a specific problem with weka. Next, they can open-source/sell it to web devs. Web devs can use REST API to train the model if they want and get reply to their instance classification query through REST apis.

#Technologies
